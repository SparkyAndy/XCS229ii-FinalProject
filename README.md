# XCS229ii-FinalProject - Classifying Computer Processes in the DARPA OpTC dataset

## Contents

This repo contains the deliverables (documents) for my Machine Learning (ML) project for the course
[XCS229ii](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs229ii-machine-learning-strategy-and-intro-reinforcement-learning) (cohort 003):

- **ProjectProposalClassifyingComputerProcessesAndrewVeal.pdf** is the first deliverable - the project proposal

- **LiteratureReviewClassifyingComputerProcessesAndrewVeal.pdf** is the second deliverable - the literature review

- **ExperimentalProtocolClassifyingComputerProcessesAndrewVealFINAL.pdf** is the third deliverable - the experimental protocol

- **FinalPaperClassifyingComputerProcessesAndrewVealFINAL.pdf** is the final deliverable - the final paper

It also contains the guidance documents for each deliverable - what the distribution of marks is and what each section of the document should cover:

- **xcs229ii_project_proposal.pdf** 

- **xcs229ii_literature_review.pdf**

- **xcs229ii_experimental_protocol.pdf**

- **xcs229ii_final_paper.pdf**

I have included the slides for a short 5 minute 'lightning' talk I gave to Course Facilitators (CFs) and fellow learners in cohort 003 (15 March 2021 - 29 May 2021):

- **XCS229iiProjectTalkForStanford15May2021StopPress.pdf**

I have also included a starter Jupyter notebook for processing the Machine Learning (ML) dataset called 
`ClassifyingComputerProcessesDarpaOpTCBaselineModel.ipynb`.

Unfortunately, I am not currently able to release the derived dataset `darpa_data_revised` (but you can make your own from the raw data on github/google drive - details of the ETL pipeline are given in the experimental protocol and final paper).
